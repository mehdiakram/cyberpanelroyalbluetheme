# CyberPanel Themes

Themes you can apply to CyberPanel and make it look good :D

*NOTE: If you are running CyberPanel 2.1.1 and below use the `legacy` branch.* <br>
*NOTE 2: This doesn't override the login and file manager CSS like the `legacy` branch. Since it is not supported to do so yet.*

2. Click design.css
3. Copy everything in the file.
4. Go to CyberPanel > Design
5. Paste the contents of design.css to the text area.
6. Save.

## How to Remove

Remove everything from the `Design` text area.
